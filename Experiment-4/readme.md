LIVE CHARACTER COUNTER FOR TEXTAREA 

" Files Created " -
We created three files for this project:

1. exp4.html

Provides the structure of the webpage.
Contains a heading, a textarea where the user types, and a counter display.
Links the external CSS (style.css) and JavaScript (script.js) files.

2. exp4.css

Defines the design and appearance of the page.
Adds background color, font styling, border styles, and focus effects for the textarea.
Ensures the counter text is styled clearly with emphasis on the character number.

3. exp4.js

Handles the functionality of the live counter.
Listens for typing events (input) inside the textarea.
Updates the counter in real time by calculating the length of the text.


RESULT -

When the project is opened in a browser, the user can type into the textarea, and the character count updates instantly as they type or delete text.

LEARNING OUTCOMES -

Understood how to separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for clean project structure.
Learned to use the input event in JavaScript for real-time updates.
Practiced DOM manipulation (getElementById, updating text content).
Enhanced skills in styling form elements with CSS.
