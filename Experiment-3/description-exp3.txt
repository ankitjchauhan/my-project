# Admin Dashboard

This is a responsive admin dashboard that I created using **HTML**, **CSS Grid**, and **JavaScript**.

## Features Implemented

- **Clean layout using CSS Grid**:
  - **Header** with the dashboard title and a theme toggle button.
  - **Sidebar** with navigation links: Home, Users, Settings.
  - **Main content area** for reports or data (currently with placeholder text).
  - **Footer** at the bottom for copyright.

- **Theme Switching**:
  - Light and dark mode support.
  - The theme changes background and text colors.
  - Works instantly without reloading the page.

This project helped me practice grid-based layouts and dynamic styling using JavaScript.
