Student Registration Form
This project is a simple web form created using HTML and CSS. It is designed to collect basic student information such as full name, email address, and age. The layout is clean and easy to understand, making it suitable for beginners learning the fundamentals of front-end web development.

The form includes:

1. A text field for the user's full name

2. An email input with built-in format validation

3. A number input for age

4. A Register button to submit the form

Styling is done using basic CSS, where the form is given a blue background to make it visually distinct. You can further improve its look by adding padding, margins, and border styling.

To use the form, simply open the index.html file in any modern web browser. Fill in the required details and click the Register button. The form is currently static and doesn't send data to a server, making it perfect for practice or front-end demonstrations.
